Automata Manipulation Project
This project is a Python-based console application designed to manipulate and test Finite Automata (FA).
It allows you to load one of 44 predefined automata and perform a variety of operations including display, standardization, determinization, completion, epsilon removal, minimization, and word recognition.

Available Actions

Once an automaton is loaded, the menu lets you:

Display the automaton

Check if it is standard

Check if it is deterministic

Check if it is complete

Standardize the automaton

Determinize the automaton

Standardize and complete the automaton

Minimize the automaton

Complete the automaton

Remove epsilon transitions

Test if a word is recognized

Load another automaton

Complementarize the automata


Automaton Files
The automata are stored as text files in the automates/ folder. Each file is named #01, #02, ..., #44. These contain information about:

Alphabet size
Number of states
Initial and terminal states
Transition rules
